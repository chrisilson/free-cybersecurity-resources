# 🧭 Cybersecurity Self-Assessment: A Starting Point

The first — and often most challenging — step in exploring the field of cybersecurity is figuring out where to begin. Cybersecurity is a broad and diverse domain, and not every role requires deep technical knowledge or coding skills.

The purpose of this self-assessment is to give you a clear set of reflection points to help identify a cybersecurity path that aligns with your interests, comfort level with technology, and long-term goals.

There are no right or wrong answers — just honest reflections. Use this as a map to discover what areas of cybersecurity might excite or motivate you most.

## ✅ Step 1: How Comfortable Are You with Technology?

Choose the statement that best describes how you relate to technology in your daily life. There are no right or wrong answers — just choose the one that feels most like you.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🟢 **Everyday Person (Tech-Aware)** | I use technology every day — like computers, smartphones, or apps — but I rarely explore how things work behind the scenes. I focus more on using tech than on modifying or building it. |
| 🟡 **Curious Explorer (Tech-Comfortable)** | I am comfortable with tech tasks — such as troubleshooting, device configuration and setup, or learning new technical tools. I enjoy figuring things out when needed. |
| 🔵 **Hands-On Builder (Tech-Inclined)** | I enjoy diving into how technology works. I’ve explored things like coding, scripting, building systems, or solving technical challenges. I like learning how tools and systems function at a deeper level. |

## ✅ Step 2: What Kind of Work Sounds Most Interesting?

Choose the cybersecurity activities that appeal to you most. These align with high-level categories of cybersecurity work. You can choose more than one — this is just a starting point.

| Interest Statement | Suggested Role Category |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| 🧠 I enjoy planning, writing policies, leading people, or thinking about big-picture risk. | **Oversight & Governance (OG)** |
| 🛠️ I like building things, writing code, or making systems work securely. | **Design & Development (DD)** |
| ⚙️ I’m drawn to running systems, managing tools, and keeping infrastructure stable. | **Implementation & Operation (IO)** |
| 🛡️ I like detecting threats, analyzing alerts, or defending against hackers. | **Protection & Defense (PD)** |
| 🔍 I enjoy investigating, solving mysteries, or digging through data to find out what happened. | **Investigation (IN)** |

💡 Not sure? It’s okay to pick more than one. These are starting points, not final decisions.
